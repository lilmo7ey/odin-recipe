    <p>Lasagna is a very popular and traditional dish that is served through families and generations over time. It is also my favorite food. As a pasta and meat lover, the combination of pasta, meat, and rich cheeses is perfect. When I first consumed it, it was almost like magic and as if heaven erupted in my mouth.</p>

            <p>A steak is a thick cut of meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, sometimes including a bone. It is normally grilled or fried. Steak can be diced, cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.</p>
